# Operating-Platforms
CS-230
The Gaming Room is a client seeking to expand their Android-based game, Draw It or Lose It, to multiple operating platforms. Their software requirements included developing a scalable, multi-user game capable of running across different platforms with efficient memory and storage management, distributed system integration, and robust security. The game’s mechanics involve rendering high-definition images at rapid speeds, requiring both client-server communication and seamless performance across all platforms.

In developing the software design document, I excelled in organizing the architecture recommendations, memory and storage management strategies, and distributed system solutions to align with the client’s needs. Working through the design document provided valuable structure for coding by clearly outlining each component, ensuring alignment with user requirements. If I could revise one part, I would improve the section on security by expanding on platform-specific encryption techniques and cross-platform user authentication methods. Understanding and implementing the user’s needs was a priority throughout the design to ensure the game provided a smooth and engaging experience for all players. In future projects, I would continue using a systematic approach to software design, focusing on clear documentation and modular development to maintain flexibility and meet evolving client needs.
